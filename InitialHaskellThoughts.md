So far, learning Haskell has been quite interesting. This language has served as my introduction to functional programming,
and has been challenging. My first few years of programming have been spent using languages like C++, C#, Python, and Java. 
It is difficult to depart from object-oriented programming when you have been doing it for your whole programming career. I 
do find it intriguing, however, how Haskell allows for quite efficient programs. The amount of power that the language has
is also impressive to me, since I imagined it would have less when I first saw what the code looked like.
These have been my thoughts for the first few weeks of learning Haskell.
