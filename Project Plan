Checkers Game

Since Haskell is a functional programming language, we thought that creating a game that took input and gave out ouput 
efficiently, while taking advantage of recursion. Checkers fit this description perfectly, because it seems like it is 
well-suited for Haskell. The main deficiency of this project and Haskell is the visual aspect, which we are going to fix 
this issue by using Python to create the visual board.
