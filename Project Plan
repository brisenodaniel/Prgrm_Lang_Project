Calculator

Initially, we had planned to do a checkers game for our program. We quickly realized that Haskell is better suited for something
that is a bit more mathematical, and requires less visual programming. We decided that a calculator would fit the language 
quite nicely, as it is a visual representaiton of pure mathematics. Hopefully, we can make full use of Haskells functionality
to make an effective calculator.
